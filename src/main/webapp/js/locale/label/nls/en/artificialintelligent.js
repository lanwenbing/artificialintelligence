	"introduction": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence exhibited by machines. In computer science, an ideal 'intelligent' machine is a flexible rational agent that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal.[1] Colloquially, the term 'artificial intelligence' is applied when a machine mimics 'cognitive' functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as 'learning' and 'problem solving'.[2] As machines become increasingly capable, facilities once thought to require intelligence are removed from the definition. For example, optical character recognition is no longer perceived as an exemplar of 'artificial intelligence' having become a routine technology.[3] Capabilities still classified as AI include advanced Chess and Go systems and self-driving cars."
